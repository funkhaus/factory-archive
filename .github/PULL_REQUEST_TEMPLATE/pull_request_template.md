name: Component Submission
title: {projectName} - {componentName}

---

Components included in this PR are:

1. {issueNumber} - {componentName} - With hover state
1. {issueNumber} - {anotherComponentName} - With color and logo variant

NOTE Ideally only one component per PR, but sometimes it makes sense to submit two together if they are linked (like a list with a listItem for example).

## Notes

Anything we need to know, perhaps a note about missing assets, or a hover state etc...
